# Tamil-Character-Recognition

Tamil, a member of the Dravidian language family spoken primarily in India. This is the official
language of Tamil Nadu, India and the Union Territory of Pondicherry (Pondicherry). Character recognition
is one of the core problems of computer vision. Based on the visual content, the input images will be assigned
to a label of a fixed set of categories. Research on Handwritten Character Recognition is increasing for better
identification of letters of a language. Handwritten character recognition is the detection of characters from
images, documents and other sources and changes them in machine-readable shape for further processing. In
HCR, a dataset of known characters is used for training in order to learn how to classify characters included
in test set accurately. Accurate recognition of complex handwritten synthetic handwriting remains a major
challenge. As there are variations in the handwriting of different individuals and even the handwriting of a
single writer may differ slightly each time, achieving hundred percent accuracy in character identification is
challenging.
For identifying and classifying the characters, Conv2D algorithm is used. Conv2D plays a vital role
in Image Classification in which, it is a Convolutional layer algorithm which is used to form a convolution
kernel which binds with input layers and produce tensor of outputs.
In this project, whiteboard is used as a tool for input where a user can write a Tamil character that is
to be identified. After writing the character, it will be exported as an image and sent for identification. It will
recognize that character and will display the character to the user.
